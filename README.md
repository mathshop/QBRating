# QBRating

Hello,

I created a short application that calculates Quarterback rating.  It is designed using a factory design pattern for future implementations of a File repository instead of only an in-memory repository.  Unit tests were implemented to ensure UI and BLL validations were worked as intended.  

Please let me know if you guys happen to find any bugs!

NOTE:
When pulling down, sometimes the packages are bugged and requires an un-install and re-install of NUnit and NUnit Test Adapter if the Tests are not showing up correctly.
